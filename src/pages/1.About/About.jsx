          <p className="indent">My name is Alex Carr, I am a Software Developer transitioning from a Controls Engineer. My interests extend further into Science and Technology. Science has been a consistent learning curve and technology advances at roughly the same rate. In order to create a more advanced and sustainable future, information technology is the key to creating it. For us to utilize and learn in the most effective way we must have more transparency with data and user friendly interfaces to draw from. So I am passionate about helping create that future through the use of new technologies.</p>
